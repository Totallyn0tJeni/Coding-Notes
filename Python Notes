Arithmetic Operators
  addition ~ +
  subtraction ~ -
  multiplication ~ *
  exponentiation ~ ** 
  division ~ /
  integer division ~ //
  modulo (remainder) ~ %

Types int and float
A type is a set of values and operations that can be performed on those values.

Two of Python's numeric types:
  int: integer
  float: floating point number (an approximation to a real number)

Arithmetic Operator Precedence
When multiple operators are combined in a single expression, the operations are evaluated in order of precedence.

  ** (exponentiation)
  - (negation)
  *, /, //, %
  + (addition), - (subtraction)

Syntax and Semantics
  Syntax: the rules that describe valid combinations of Python symbols
  Semantics: the meaning of a combination of Python symbols is the meaning of an instruction â€” what a particular combination of symbols does when you execute it.
  Errors

A syntax error occurs when we an instruction with invalid syntax is executed. For example:
>>> 3) + 2 * 4
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

A semantic error occurs when an instruction with invalid semantics is executed. For example:
>>> 89.4 / 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in
    89.4 / 0
ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero

Python and Computer Memory

Computer Memory
For the purpose of this course, you may think of computer memory as a long list of storage locations where each location is identified with a unique number and each location houses a value. This unique number is called a memory address. Typically, we will write memory addresses as a number with an "id" as a prefix to distinguish them from other numbers (for example, id201 is memory address 201).
Variables are a way to keep track of values stored in computer memory. A variable is a named location in computer memory. Python keeps variables in a separate list from values. A variable will contain a memory address, and that memory address contains the value. The variable then refers to the value. Python will pick the memory addresses for you.

Terminology
  A value has a memory address.
  A variable contains a memory address.
  A variable refers to a value.
  A variable points to a value.

Example: Value 8.5 has memory address id34.
         Variable shoe_size contains memory address id34.
         The value of shoe_size is 8.5.
         shoe_size refers to value 8.5.
         shoe_size points to value 8.5.

Variables

Assignment statements
The general form of an assignment statement:
variable = expression
